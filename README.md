# AdamsMod
## AdamsMod aims to make Factorio more complex and more punishing.

### Warning! Work in progress!
This mod and many of it's dependencies are very much a Work In Progress. Please be aware that I have not had time to tweak everything and that Freeplay mode may have problems I've not yet solved.

## Mods and ideas not yet included

- You'll have to deal with mass amounts of garbage, because every recipe now produces waste. The only thing you can do is sequester it in giant, permanent, sequesters or burn it, releasing pollution.

### Maintenance Madness
Your machines breakdown without maintenance.

### Realistic Reactors
Nuclear reactors must be controlled with signals or they will meltdown.

### Fusion reactors
Use hydrogen to make power. Requires a huge initial charge to jump start the reaction and continuous supply of water.
