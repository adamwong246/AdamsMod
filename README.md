# AdamsMod

So you've launched some rockets and now you are bored of infinite research... Are you ready for a new challenge? AdamsMod aims to make Factorio more complex and more punishing.

AdamsMod makes factorio much much harder. Your Portable Fusion Reactor no longer gives free power, nor does your offshore pumps. Similarly, unpowered belts have been entirely removed. You'll have to use inserters, trains and drones to get things around. Your characters reach is now very short, making manual building a frustrating experience. The nights are longer and darker too- you'll need far more accumulators to make it through the night. Your power grid is now much more liable to fail, because laser turrets now have the same priority as the rest of your machines. Power poles now explode when you pass too much electricity through them- luckily, transformers have been introduced to step-down power from a high power grid to smaller low power grids.

### Warning! Work in progress!
This mod and many of it's dependencies are very much a Work In Progress. Please be aware that I have not had time to tweak everything and that Freeplay mode may have problems I've not yet solved.

## Mods included

### Game-altering mods

#### No Free Lunch
Items which produce "free" power have been replaced with powered alternatives.

#### Short Reach
An attempt to balance the gameplay away from manual labor by limiting your reach, forcing you to rely upon drones.

#### Power Ranger
Managing your electrical grid is harder.

#### Clockwork
Makes the nights as long as the days.

#### Power Overload
Power poles explode when watts exceeds capacity.

#### Electric Transformators
Use transformers to transfer power from one electric grid to another. Also used a watt-regulator.

### Cosmetic mods

#### Uranium Geiger
Geiger counter sounds when you are new uranium.

#### Desire Paths
A cosmetic change that creates naturally forming dirt paths. Wherever you walk, the ground will become bare.

#### No Animations
Preserve RAM by disabling animations.

#### Bottleneck
In the absence of animations, use a simple color indicator to signal the status of a machine

## Mods and ideas not yet included

- You'll have to deal with mass amounts of garbage, because every recipe now produces waste. The only thing you can do is sequester it in giant, permanent, sequesters or burn it, releasing pollution.

### Maintenance Madness
Your machines breakdown without maintenance.

### Realistic Reactors
Nuclear reactors must be controlled with signals or they will meltdown.

### Fusion reactors
Use hydrogen to make power. Requires a huge initial charge to jump start the reaction and continuous supply of water.

## Credits
Most of this is cobbled together by sourcing and copying from other people's mods. There are too many to list here but thank you to you all!
