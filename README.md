# AdamsMod

So you've launched some rockets and now you are bored of infinite research... Are you ready for a new challenge? AdamsMod aims to make Factorio more complex and more punishing.

This mod and many of it's dependencies are very much a Work In Progress. Please be aware that I have not had time to tweak these mods and that Freeplay mode may have problems I've not yet solved.
