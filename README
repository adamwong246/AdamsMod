# AdamsMod

This modpack contains many mods, some of my own creation and some not. Without besmiching vanilla, these mods are what I consider "improvements" to the base game. 

## Mods included

### Desire Paths
A cosmetic change that creates naturally forming dirt paths. Wherever you walk, the ground will become bare.

### Short Reach
An attempt to balance the gameplay away from manual labor by limiting your reach, forcing you to rely upon drones.

### No Animations
Preserve RAM by disabling animations.

### Bottleneck
In the absence of animations, use a simple color indicator to signal the status of a machine
