# AdamsMod

This modpack contains many mods, some of my own creation and some not. Without besmiching vanilla, these mods are what I consider "improvements" to the base game. 

## Goals

AdamsMod aims to make Factorio harder and more punishing. It removes many quality-of-life features which I believe make the game too easy. It also adds a few fun flairs!

## Mods included

### Desire Paths
A cosmetic change that creates naturally forming dirt paths. Wherever you walk, the ground will become bare.

### Short Reach
An attempt to balance the gameplay away from manual labor by limiting your reach, forcing you to rely upon drones.

### No Animations
Preserve RAM by disabling animations.

### Bottleneck
In the absence of animations, use a simple color indicator to signal the status of a machine

### Uranium Geiger
Geiger counter sounds when you are new uranium.

### No Free Lunch
The Personal Fusion now requires fuel.

## Mods yet to be included

### Maintenance Madness
Your machines breakdown without maintenance. 

### Realistic Reactors
Nuclears reactors must be controlled with signals or they will meltdown.

### Dumb Steam Engines
Steam engines will not scale down with electricity satisfaction. You must control them with signals or they will waste coal and spew pollution.

### PFR Begone
Nerfs the Personal Fusion Reactor, because it should not provide free electricty.

### Pack chargers
Foot-powered exoskeleton and wireless charging pads that fill the role that PFRs once held.

### Fusion reactors
Use hydrogen to make power. Requires a huge initial charge to jump start the reaction and continuous supply of hydrogen.
